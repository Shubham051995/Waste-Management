      <h2><a href="#">Waste Management System</a></h2>
      <span class="byline"> Waste management is the process of treating solid wastes and offers variety of solutions for recycling items that don’t belong to trash. It is about how garbage can be used as a valuable resource. Waste management is something that each and every household and business owner in the world needs.

    <p> “Waste management or Waste disposal is all the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes amongst other things, collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste together with monitoring and regulation. It also encompasses the legal and regulatory framework that relates to waste management encompassing guidance on recycling etc.”
You will find there are eight major groups of waste management methods, each of them divided into numerous categories. Those groups include source reduction and reuse, animal feeding, recycling, composting, fermentation, landfills, incineration and land application. You can start using many techniques right at home, like reduction and reuse, which works to reduce the amount of disposable material used.

          <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management">Landfills</a></h3>
        </header>
        <p> Throwing daily waste/garbage in the landfills is the most popularly used method of waste disposal used today. This process of waste disposal focuses attention on burying the waste in the land. Landfills are commonly found in developing countries. There is a process used that eliminates the odors and dangers of waste before it is placed into the ground. While it is true this is the most popular form of waste disposal. </p>

          <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management">Incineration/Combustion</a></h3>
        </header>
        <p> Incineration or combustion is a type disposal method in which municipal solid wastes are burned at high temperatures so as as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. The biggest advantage of this type of method is that it can reduce the volume of solid waste to 20 to 30 percent of the original volume, decreases the space they take up and reduce the stress on landfills. </p>

          <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management">Recovery and Recycling</a></h3>
        </header>
        <p> Recycling is the process of converting waste products into new products to prevent energy usage and consumption of fresh raw materials. Recycling is the third component of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle waste hierarchy. The idea behind recycling is to reduce energy usage, reduce volume of landfills, reduce air and water pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and preserve natural resources for future use. </p>

          <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management#">Plasma gasification</a></h3>
        </header>
        <p> Plasma gasification is another form of waste management. Plasma is a primarily an electrically charged or a highly ionized gas. Lighting is one type of plasma which produces temperatures that exceed 12,600 °F . With this method of waste disposal, a vessel uses characteristic plasma torches operating at +10,000 °F which is  creating a gasification zone till 3,000 °F for the conversion of solid or liquid wastes into a syngas. </p>

          <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management">Composting</a></h3>
        </header>
        <p> Composting is a easy and natural bio-degradation process that takes organic wastes i.e. remains of plants and garden and kitchen waste and turns into nutrient rich food for your plants. Composting, normally used for organic farming, occurs by allowing organic materials to sit in one place for months until microbes decompose it. Composting is one of the best method of waste disposal as it can turn unsafe organic products into safe compost. </p>

          <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management">Waste to Energy (Recover Energy)</a></h3>
        </header>
        <p>Waste to energy(WtE) process involves converting of non-recyclable waste items  into useable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes. This type of source of energy is a renewable energy source as non-recyclable waste can be used over and over again to create energy. It can also help to reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources. </p>
