          <p>Having trouble keeping up with your family's garbage output? Putting a bit more thought into the way you manage your household waste can help you get more organized. With careful planning, you'll be able to save money and have less of an impact on the environment. Recycling is the third component of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle waste hierarchy. The idea behind recycling is to reduce energy usage, reduce volume of landfills, reduce air and water pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and preserve natural resources for future use. </p>

            <p> Poorly managed waste spreads disease, contaminates water resources, increases the cost of potable water, increases flooding, pollutes the air, and repulses tourists. But municipalities have neither the money nor the skills to manage solid waste well. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, municipal waste management can amount to 30 to 50 percent of a municipality’s total annual budget. </p>
            <p> The developing world tends to rely on informal waste pickers, who comprise five percent of urban jobs in developing economies. But these small scale solutions are inefficient and difficult to regulate. Global experience points to the benefits of integrated management and PPPs. </p>

            <p> But the solid waste sector isn’t a natural fit for PPPs, as some other sectors are. From a commercial or financial perspective, cost recovery from households in the form of fees paid for trash collection is generally very poor. Industrial waste collection can be more lucrative, but rarely covers costs. Sanitary landfills are expensive. But there is hope where the disposal of solid waste is carefully planned to generate revenues and manage waste effectively. </p>

          <p>Carbon finance can be accessed through the reduction of methane gas, generation of renewable electricity, and the reduction of carbon footprint by offsetting other thermal heat generation. Potential annual carbon finance in Sub-Saharan Africa may amount to around $2.6 million per million people for landfill gas recovery, $1.3 million for composting, and $3.5 million for recycling. But even these amounts are less than 10 percent of waste management costs. </p>

          <p>  User fees for collection of solid waste are usually kept artificially low. Collection can be facilitated by combining waste management bills with electricity bills (as in Mombasa) or water bills (as in Addis Ababa). Municipal taxes can provide a solid revenue stream, but are usually spread over a small part of the total population.</p>

        </header>
        <p> If you have a garden, consider making use of food waste as compost rather than discarding it. Organic materials such as fruit rind, onion peel and shredded paper can be collected in tub before closing the lid and leaving the material to decompose.</p>

        <p> The amount of waste disposal can be reduced by carefully considering exactly what you are throwing away. Before automatically discarding items, think about whether it would be possible to wash and reuse them.  </p>
