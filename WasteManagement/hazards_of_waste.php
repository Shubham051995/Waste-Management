          </header>
          <p> waste is any substance that is considered not useful in the environment and can be harmful to human health.We have two types of waste which are solid and liquid waste, the solid waste consist of used plastic bags, damage home appliance, etc. whiles liquid waste consist of used water from bath, washing, decompose fecal matter and oil.</p>

            <span class="byline"> Industrial and manufacturing processes create solid and hazardous waste. </span> </header>
          <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic21.png" alt=""></a>
          <p>Some waste will eventually rot, but not all, and in the process it may smell or generate methane gas, which is explosive and contributes to the greenhouse effect. ... Gases from incineration may cause air pollution and contribute to acid rain, while the ash from incinerators may contain heavy metals and other toxins. </p>

              <h3>Landfill sites</h3>
            </header>
            <p>One of the mostly widely known and publicized landfill sites is that of Love Canal in New York State. Large quantities of toxic materials, including residues from pesticides production, were deposited in the 1930s and 1940s, followed by the building of houses and a school on and around the landfill in the 1950s. By the mid 1970s, chemicals leaking from the site were detected in local streams, sewers, soil and indoor air of houses. This site and the subsequent studies of the health of the population in the vicinity fuelled public opinion on the problems of waste disposal practices and raised public concern more generally.</p>

              <h3>Birth defects and reproductive disorders</h3>
            </header>
            <p> Reproductive effects associated with landfill sites have been extensively researched and include low birth weight (less than 2500 g), fetal and infant mortality, spontaneous abortion, and the occurrence of birth defects. Vianna and Polan13 and Goldman et al14 both found increased incidence of low birth weight in the populations around the Love Canal site, the former during the period of active dumping (1940–1953) and the latter among house owners (although not among those renting) from 1965 to 1978. A similar increase in the proportion of low birth weight babies was found in those living within a radius of 1 km of the Lipari Landfill in New Jersey, particularly in 1971–75 following a period of heavy pollution of streams and a nearby lake from leachate from the site. </p>
            <p>Trends in low birth weight and neonatal deaths were found to correspond closely with time and quantities of dumping at a large hazardous waste disposal site in California, with significantly lower birth weights in exposed areas than control areas during the periods of heaviest dumping16. It should be noted that exposed areas were defined according to the number of odour complaints rather than any more objective measure.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Several geographical comparison studies have investigated cancer mortality and incidence around waste sites. Increased frequency of cancers in counties containing hazardous waste sites was found in two US studies25,26, particularly for gastrointestinal, oesophageal, stomach, colon and rectal cancer. </p>

        </header>
        <p> Many of the studies investigating health outcomes other than birth defects and reproductive orders and cancers have been community health surveys and have relied on the self-reporting of symptoms through interviews or questionnaires. These are comprehensively reviewed by Vrijheid. </p>

        <p> Evaluation of the potential health effects of the large number of pollutants which can be produced by waste incineration can be approached by assessing the effects of individual pollutants8,32 or through more general studies of community residents33 and incinerator workers . </p>
